# Aim of the research

The concept of a virtual world has been around for many years but only recently, with the reached maturity in display and wearable technologies, with the increase of bandwidth and in-network computational capability, and with the development of artificial intelligence, 
the Metaverse and other hyper-realistic fully immersive communication systems can develop, paving the way to new scientific and business opportunities. To fully unleash this potential there is the need to tackle fundamental research to assure that the deployed services 
reach the expected quality of experience, allowing for empathic communications, providing the real feel of presence, and ensuring the expected content and user authenticity, thanks also to the full power of future network architectures. These issues are addressed by FUN-Media, 
which aims at: i) defining the architecture and functionalities of a human digital twin to support the deployment and management of the relevant multi-sense communications by monitoring and modeling the user in terms of emotions, experiences, locations, environment,
preferences and actions; ii) experimenting sensors for novel foreseen interactions and to capture emotions, through Brain-Computer Interfaces, which require revisiting traditional low level processing and  interaction with VRs, ARs, XRs; iii) defining appropriate 
solutions to deliver experience-aware services by exploiting all the available resources in the continuum from the device to the cloud and protect all the highly sensitive information; iv) overcoming the limitations of current media formats and descriptions by defining 
extended and more compact representation with embedded recoverable semantics.
